# Introduction to database
**Database**: Database is a **collection of inter-related data** which helps in efficient retrieval, insertion and deletion of data from database and organizes the data in the form of tables, views, schemas, reports etc. For example, university database organizes the data about students, faculty, and admin staff etc. which helps in efficient retrieval, insertion and deletion of data from it

Basically:
* **database design**: we'll describe an organization from the real world, like university, hospital, in terms of the data stored in the database
* **data analysis**: we'll answear questions about the organization by writing querys over the data in the database

**If we want to use a database, we must first describe the data according to a data model.**

# Data description model (DDM)
**Data modeling** (data modelling) **is the process of creating a data model for the data to be stored in a database**. Data modeling helps in the visual representation of data and enforces business rules, regulatory compliances, and government policies on the data. 

**The Data Description Model is a set of concepts and rules used to model data**. These concepts are used to **describe the structure of the data**, to **specify consistency 
constraints**(that is correctness constrains) and to **describe relationships among data**. It is defined as an abstract model that organizes data description, data semantics, and consistency constraints of data. The data model **emphasizes on what data is needed and how it should be organized** instead of what operations will be performed on data. Data Model is like an architectâ€™s building plan, which helps to build conceptual models and set a relationship between data items.

**schema of the database** = certain data structures are used in order to describe a collection of data stored in a database, and they constitute the schema.
**instances of the schema** = the data items in the collection that follow the schema

Examples of DDM:
* **Entity-Relationship Model**
* **Relational Model**
