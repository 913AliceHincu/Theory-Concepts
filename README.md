# Theory & Concepts
I have created this repository for myself, but you are free to read anything from here. What is this repository you may ask? Here I created different "readme" files about programming, a more "in-depth" view of how programming works. These are the answears of some questions/concerns that I had in the past. By doing this, not only I inform myself about this, I also can come back to remember/read more.
