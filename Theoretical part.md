### 1
In a SELECT query: <br>
**! a !**. the SELECT clause can contain arithmetic expressions <br>
b. according to the conceptual evaluation strategy, ORDER BY is evaluated before GROUP BY <br>
c. HAVING can contain row-level qualification conditions <br>
**! d !**. DISTINCT eliminates duplicates from the answer set <br>
e. none of the above is correct. <br>

### 1-EXPLANATION
b. We have: FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, SELECT, ORDER BY <br>
c. it specifies group-level qualification conditions, it doesn't do row. For row-level it's WHERE. <br>

### 2
The natural join operator R1 * R2 in the relational algebra: <br>
a. returns a relation whose schema contains only the attributes in R1 that don't appear in R2 <br>
**! b !**. returns a relation whose schema contains all the attributes in R1 and R2, with common attributes appearing only once <br>
c. returns 2 relation instances <br>
d. is not associative <br>
e. none of the above is correct. <br>

### 2-EXPLANATION
c. It returns a single relation instance

### 3
In the ANSI-SPARC architecture (for a database system), a database can have: <br>
a. exactly one symbolic structure <br>
b. several conceptual structures <br>
**! c 1**. several external structures <br>
d. several physical structures <br>
e. none of the above is correct. <br>

### 3-EXPLANATION
a. There is no symbolic structure in ANSI-SPARC <br>
b. Conceptual structure describes the structures, the data structures and the restrictions in your databases(like the schema), so you have a single **collection of data**(=instance of the schema) in a database, so no several structures. <br>
c. We can have multiple views for example

4. Consider relation S[A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H] with:
* primary key {A, B, C}, no other candidate keys;
* functional dependencies that are known to hold over S: {F} ‚Üí {H}, {C} ‚Üí {E, G};
* no repeating attributes.
a. S is not 1NF <br>
b. S is 2NF <br>
**! c !**. S is not BCNF <br>
d. S is 3NF <br>
e. none of the above answers is correct.

### 4-EXPLANATION 
a. it is in 1NF because it doesn't have any repeating attributes. <br>
b. It is not 2NF because it has a dependency: {C} -> {E, G}

### 5
5. In a B-tree of order 8:
**! a !**. a non-terminal node has at most 8 subtrees <br>
**! b !**. a non-terminal node with 7 values has 8 subtrees <br>
c. terminal nodes can be on different levels
d. a non-terminal node with 7 values has 6 subtrees <br>
e. none of the above answers is correct.

### 5-EXPLANATION 
Every non-terminal node has at most m subtrees and m/2 subtrees and m-1 values.

### 6
6. Let ùõº, ùõΩ and ùõæ be subsets of attributes in a relational schema. If ùõº ‚Üí ùõΩ and ùõΩ ‚Üí ùõæ, then by transitivity:
**! a !**. ùõº ‚Üí ùõæ <br>
b. ùõæ ‚Üí ùõº <br>
c. ùõΩ ‚Üí ùõº <br>
d. ùõæ ‚Üí ùõΩ <br>
e. none of the above answers is correct.

### 7
Let RepairLog[RID, MechanicID, RollerCoasterID, RepairTime] be a table in a SQL Server database. RepairLog has 100.000 records and 2 indexes: a unique clustered index on RID and a non-clustered index on MechanicID without nonkey columns.

Consider the following query:
```sql
SELECT RID, MechanicID, RepairTime
FROM RepairLog
WHERE MechanicID = 7
```
If the execution plan contains an Index Seek (NonClustered), it also contains a: <br>
a. Clustered Index Scan <br>
b. Index Scan (NonClustered) <br>
**! c !**. Key Lookup (Clustered) <br>
d. Index Trick (NonClustered) <br>
e. none of the above answers is correct. <br>

### 7-EXPLANATION
The Index Seek (NonClustered) is used because we make a search on MechanicID, and the SELECT clause contains also RepairTime which is not includeed in the NonClustered Index, so for this the SQL server performs a key look up in order to retrieve the value of RepairTime maching MechanicID = 7.

RID is used as a row locator in the NonClustered Index, and this RID value is taken and  basically a Clustered Index operation is carried out which is called a key lookup.

Btw: you need to make MechanicID unique to work. And if you add RepairTime to the as a nonkey column, then you don't do a key look up anymore

### 8-10
Consider the relational schema S[FK1, FK2, A, B, C, D, E], with primary key {FK1, FK2}. Answer questions 8-10 using the legal instance below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53339016/150860554-db54f13d-e11a-4d8e-9c75-7edf71277483.png)

### 8
Consider queries Q1 and Q2:
```sql
-- Q1:
SELECT *
FROM S s1 LEFT JOIN S s2 ON s1.FK1 = s2.E
-- Q2:
SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM S s1 INNER JOIN S s2 ON s1.FK1 = s2.E
```

8. The cardinality of the answer set of Qi is denoted by |Qi|. |Q1| - |Q2| is:
a. 0 <br>
b. 3 <br>
c. 10 <br>
d. 2 <br>
e. none of the above answers is correct.

### 8-EXPLANATION
For Q1: you have the concatenation of s1.FK1=2(2 rows) and s2.E=2(3 rows), which meand we will have 6 rows that respect the condition. For s1.FK1=1(3rows), we don't have any match, so we put them with null. It means 9 rows, so cardinality 9

For Q2: same thing about the concatenation, so 6 rows.

Q2-Q1=3.

### 9
9. Regarding the functional dependencies of S:
**! a !**. at least one of the following dependencies is not satisfied by the instance: {A} ‚Üí {B}, {FK1, FK2} ‚Üí {A, B}, {FK1} ‚Üí {A} <br>
b. by examining the instance, we can conclude that at least one of the following dependencies is specified on the schema S: {A} ‚Üí {B}, {FK1} ‚Üí {A, B}, {FK1} ‚Üí {A} <br>
c. at least two of the following dependencies are not satisfied by the instance: {FK2} ‚Üí {A, B}, {A} ‚Üí {E}, {A, B} ‚Üí {E}, {FK1, FK2} ‚Üí {E} <br>
d. by examining the instance, we can conclude that at least two of the following dependencies are specified on the schema S: {FK2} ‚Üí {A, B}, {A} ‚Üí {E}, {A, B} ‚Üí {E}, {B} ‚Üí {C, E} <br>
e. none of the above answers is correct.

### 9-EXPLANATION
a. {A} -> {B} is satisfied because we have 2 rows where a3 -> b3, and {FK1, FK2} ‚Üí {A, B} hold because it is a primary key, but the last one doesn't hold. <br>
b. Just by looking at the instance, you can never draw conclusions about the specification of certain integrity constraints(dependencies included) on the relational schema. <br>
c. Everything except {FK2} ‚Üí {A, B} is satisfied  <br>
d. same as b

### 10
Consider queries Q1 and Q2:
```sql
-- Q1:
SELECT FK2, FK1, COUNT(DISTINCT B)
FROM S
GROUP BY FK2, FK1
HAVING FK1 = 0

-- Q2:
SELECT FK2, FK1, COUNT(C)
FROM S
GROUP BY FK2, FK1
HAVING MAX(E) < 0
```

The cardinality of the answer set of Qi is denoted by |Qi|.
10. |Q1| - |Q2| is:
**! a !**. 0 <br>
b. 2 <br>
c. 1 <br>
d. -1 <br>
e. none of the above answers is correct

### 10-EXPLANATION
|Q1| = |Q2| = 0

### 11
11. A secondary index:
**! a !**. can contain duplicates <br>
b. cannot contain duplicates <br>
**! c !**. can be non-clustered <br>
d. cannot be non-clustered <br>
e. none of the above answers is correct <br>

### 11-EXPLANATION
**A secondary index** = it's the one whose search key does not include the primary key. 

**Duplicates** = data entries with the same value for the search key.
