### Namespace

In computing, a namespace is a set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects 
have unique names so that they can be easily identified. Namespaces are commonly structured as hierarchies to allow reuse of names in different contexts. As an analogy, 
consider a system of naming of people where each person has a given name, as well as a family name shared with their relatives. If the first names of family members are 
unique only within each family, then each person can be uniquely identified by the combination of first name and family name; there is only one Jane Doe, though there may 
be many Janes. Within the namespace of the Doe family, just "Jane" suffices to unambiguously designate this person, while within the "global" namespace of all people, the 
full name must be used.

### Pass by value
The argument is evaluated, and a copy of the evaluation result is bound to the formal parameter of the function

### Pass by reference
Function receives a reference to the actual argument, rather than a copy to its value
