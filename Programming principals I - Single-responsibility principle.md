# Single-responsibility principle
The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer-programming principle that states that every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility 
over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part. All of that module, class or function's services should be narrowly aligned with that 
responsibility.

Basically:
<ul>
  <li>Each function should be responsible for one thing</li>
  <li>Each class should represent one entity</li>
  <li>Each module should address one aspect of the application</li>
</ul>

## Encapsulation
In object-oriented programming (OOP), encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an 
object's components. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing direct access to them by clients in a way that 
could expose hidden implementation details or violate state invariance maintained by the methods.
