# Separation of concerns
In computer science, separation of concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections. Each section addresses a separate concern, a 
set of information that affects the code of a computer program. A concern can be as general as "the details of the hardware for an application", or as specific as "the name of 
which class to instantiate". A program that embodies SoC well is called a modular program. Modularity, and hence separation of concerns, is achieved by encapsulating information 
inside a section of code that has a well-defined interface. Encapsulation is a means of information hiding. Layered designs in information systems are another embodiment of 
separation of concerns (e.g., presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer, persistence layer).

Basically: Separate the program into distinct sections, Each section addresses a particular concern \
**concern** = information that affects the code of a computer program

## HTML, CSS, JS
HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript (JS) are complementary languages used in the development of web pages and websites. 
HTML is mainly used for organization of webpage content, CSS is used for definition of content presentation style, and JS defines how the content interacts and behaves with the 
user. Historically, this was not the case: prior to the introduction of CSS, HTML performed both duties of defining semantics and style. These are an example of SoC.
