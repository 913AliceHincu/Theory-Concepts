# Introduction
**The Java Development Kit (JDK)** is one of three core technology packages used in Java programming, along with the **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** and the **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**. It's important to differentiate between these three technologies, as well as understanding how they're connected:

* The **JVM** is the Java platform component that executes programs.
* The **JRE** is the on-disk part of Java that creates the JVM.
* The **JDK** allows developers to create Java programs that can be executed and run by the JVM and JRE.

Developers new to Java often confuse the Java Development Kit and the Java Runtime Environment. The distinction is that the JDK is a package of tools for developing Java-based software, whereas the JRE is a package of tools for running Java code.

The JRE can be used as a standalone component to simply run Java programs, but it's also part of the JDK. The JDK requires a JRE because running Java programs is part of developing them.


# JDK
**Java Development Kit (JDK)** is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets(any small application that performs one specific task that runs within the scope of a dedicated widget engine or a larger program, often as a plug-in). It includes:
* the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
* an interpreter/loader (Java)
* a compiler (javac)
* an archiver (jar)
* a documentation generator (Javadoc)
* and other tools needed in Java development.

* Technical definition: The JDK is an implementation of the Java platform specification, including compiler and class libraries.
* Everyday definition: The JDK is a software package you download in order to create Java-based applications.

In addition to the JRE, which is the environment used to run Java applications, every JDK contains a Java compiler. The compiler is the software program capable of taking raw .java files--which are plain text--and rendering them into executable .class files
